## Prerequisites

To run the program, you will need to have .NET 9.0 or later installed. You can download it from the official [.NET website](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download).

## Installation

1. Create a folder where the code is to be installed (e.g., `Chess` folder).
2. Open Terminal and change the directory to the folder you just created.
3. Run the following git command to clone the repository:
    ` git clone https://github.com/lepned/EngineBattle.git `
4. Change the directory to the `WebGUI` folder inside the newly created `EngineBattle` folder:
    ` cd EngineBattle/WebGUI `
    
5. Run the following dotnet command to start the application:    
    ` dotnet run -c release `

A console application should now run with a link to the localhost URL. Ctrl + click on the link to open the URL in the browser (most testing is done in Edge browser). You should now be able to see the web GUI in the browser. 
To keep your local copy of this repo updated, navigate to the `EngineBattle` folder in the console and run:

` git pull origin master `

## Configuration

Before you can do much with the GUI, you need to configure all the engines you want to use. Follow these steps to configure `EngineSetup`:

1. Edit the `tournament.json` file located under the `wwwroot` folder in `WebGUI` - [Link to Tournament.json](Tournament.json.md).
    - The tournament.json file will be automatically created and placed in the `wwwroot` folder on first startup if it doesn't already exist.
    - If the tournament.json file is not present (for unknown reasons), you can create one by copying the `Tournament.json` file from the link above and pasting it into the `wwwroot` folder.
2. Create and define the folder where all `engineDefs` are located. Set the path to this folder under the key: `EngineDefFolder`.
3. Every engine needs an `EngineDef.json` file - [Link to EngineDef.json](EngineDef.json.md) / [Link to LC0Def.json](LC0Def.json.md). Make a copy, configure each engine as you wish, and save it with a proper name like `SFDef.json` for Stockfish.
4. Add all your `EngineDef.json` files that will be part of the tournament under the key: `EngineDefList`. See below for an example of how to do this.
    ```
      "EngineSetup": {
        "EngineDefFolder": "C:/Dev/Chess/Engines/EngineDefs",
         "EngineDefList": [
            "SFDef.json",
            "Lc0Def.json",
            "DragonDef.json"  ]}
    ```
### Folder Structure Example

```
#folder structure example

Engines/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ EngineDefs/
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ SFDef.json
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Lc0Def.json
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ DragonDef.json
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ LC0/
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Lc0.exe
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ SF/
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ SF.exe
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Dragon/
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Dragon.exe
```

3. Set the `OpeningsPath` and the `PgnOutPath` and time settings. Time controls, `MoveOverhead`, and `DelayBetweenGames` (or any other time settings) are specified in `HH:MM:SS:MMM` (MMM = milliseconds).
4. The `UseTBAdjudication` can be turned on and off.

After you have created and configured a `tournament.json` file on your computer, it is highly advisable to make a backup copy. This ensures you can quickly restore your settings if you need to reinstall the application or encounter any configuration issues.

### Images

The `wwwroot` folder includes a selection of images used by the program, located in the Img subfolder. To add new images for engines you include in tournaments, simply place them in the `Img` folder as .png or .jpg files if the image does not already exist there. This allows you to customize the visual representation of each engine in your tournaments.

## Running a Tournament

Use your browser‚Äôs built-in zoom function to adjust the GUI size to your preference. For streaming, it‚Äôs recommended to set the zoom level to 80% or 90%, depending on your screen resolution and size. 
Press F11 to enter full-screen mode ‚Äî this is also recommended for the best streaming experience.

To operate a tournament, you only need two keys:

- To start a tournament run, press: `ctrl + r`
- To cancel a tournament run, press: `ctrl + c`

Other useful keys are:

- Validate your tournament.json which includes basic validation for all engine.json files, press: `ctrl + v`
- Update and refresh tournament GUI, press: `ctrl + u`

It is strongly recommended to run validation before starting a tournament to ensure that all engine definitions are correct and that the tournament settings are valid.

When the tournament is running, you can use the GUI to follow the games, check the standings, and view the results. The GUI is designed to be user-friendly and intuitive, providing real-time updates and visualizations to enhance the tournament experience.
The console window will display additional tournament progress, including pairings, game results, standings, and other relevant information that can be useful for monitoring the tournament.

### Time Controls
Time controls settings are specified in `HH:MM:SS:MMM` format, where `HH` is hours, `MM` is minutes, `SS` is seconds, and `MMM` is milliseconds. For example, a fixed time control of `00:01:00:000` with an Increment of `00:00:01:000` represents a time control of 1 minute and 1 second increment.
Each time control listed in the `tournament.json` file needs to have an Id and each engine.json file needs to have a corresponding time control Id that references on of the time controls in the `tournament.json` file.
You can use node limits instead of time limits by setting the `NodesLimit` value to true, and the number of `nodes` you want to use in your test, in the `tournament.json` file.
Example of a time control that can be used to run policy tests:

```
{
  "Id": 1,
  "Fixed": "00:01:00.000",
  "Increment": "00:00:01.000",
  "NodeLimit": true,
  "Nodes": 1
}
```

It is recommended to run policy tests in Console Mode for optimal performance by running games in parallel, see below how to set that up. However, you can also run these tests using the GUI by setting a delay per move. To do this, configure the `MinMoveTime` parameter to i.e. 2000 milliseconds in the GUI settings. This allows you to watch every move play out during policy tests and can even be streamed.

### Tournament Console Mode

The console mode is designed for quick and efficient testing, allowing users to run multiple games in parallel for benchmarking purposes. This mode is ideal for policy matches and very quick time controls, such as 20 + 0.3 seconds or less.
In order to use the console mode you need to start the application from the Console folder and run the following command:

` dotnet run -c release tournamentjson <fullPathToYourTournament.json> `

There is a setting in the `tournament.json` file that allows you to set the number of games that can be run in parallel in the console mode. This setting is called `NumberOfGamesInParallelConsoleOnly` and can be set to any number you like. The default value is 2 but values up-to 4 games can be recommended for a strong GPU. If you run games in parallel 'PreventMoveDeviation' feature will be disabled, see below.

### PreventMoveDeviation Feature

The **"PreventMoveDeviation"** feature is designed to enhance engine testing by enforcing a consistent move order across different game formats. Stockfish, for example, typically deviates from earlier games played in the same position‚Äîabout twice per game‚Äîwhich can introduce inconsistencies in testing.

**Important**: This feature requires **single-threaded tournament execution** because the deviation prevention logic must sequentially compare each engine's move choice against its previous play history in the same position. Running games in parallel would prevent this cross-reference mechanism from working correctly.

By strictly adhering to a reference-based move order and tracking position hashes, this feature ensures that recurring board states are consistently recognized, even when transpositions occur. This controlled approach is beneficial in both gauntlet tournaments‚Äîwhere one or more engines play against every other participant‚Äîand in normal round-robin tournaments, where engines are prevented from deviating from moves they have previously played in the same position. As a result, testers can evaluate and compare engine performance with greater precision under these uniform conditions.

### Live Plot Charts for MCTS Engines
The live plot charts (N-Plot and Q-Plot) are particularly useful for visualizing the internal thinking or search process of Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) engines like Lc0 and Ceres. These charts provide insights into how these engines evaluate positions and make decisions during the game.

- **N-Plot Chart**: Displays the top N moves by nodes visited (%) during the search window, along with Q (evaluation) and policy (P %) values. If the top policy move is not part of the top N moves, it will also show this move in red with Q and P values. This chart helps in understanding how the search is biased during gameplay and how strongly the policy prefers one move over another.
- **Q-Plot Chart**: Shows the top N moves by Q-value (evaluation) during the search window, along with nodes visited (N %) and policy (P %) values. If the top policy move is not part of the top N Q-moves, it will show this move in red with N and P values. This chart provides a detailed view of the engine's evaluation process and the influence of the policy network.

### Evaluation Chart
- **Eval Chart**: Displays evaluation statistics for the tournament. It is referenced by `evalChart`.

### Time Usage Chart
- **Time Usage Chart**: Shows the time usage statistics for the tournament. It is referenced by `timeUsageChart`.

### Nodes Per Second (NPS) Chart
- **NPS Chart**: Displays the nodes per second statistics. It is referenced by `npsChart`.

### Nodes Per Move (NPM) Chart
- **NPM Chart**: Shows the nodes per move statistics for the tournament. It is referenced by `nodesChart`.

These charts are conditionally rendered based on the tournament's layout options and settings, providing a comprehensive view of the tournament's progress and performance metrics.


### End of game result

The `ResultReason` type defines various reasons for the outcome of a chess game. Each reason is represented by a specific code and an explanation. Below is a summary of the type:

- **Checkmate (CM)**: The game ended in checkmate.
- **Stalemate (SM)**: The game ended in a stalemate.
- **AdjudicateTB (TB)**: The game was adjudicated based on tablebase knowledge.
- **AdjudicateMaterial (AM)**: The game was adjudicated due to insufficient material.
- **ExcessiveMoves (50m)**: The game ended due to excessive moves (50-move rule).
- **Repetition (R3)**: The game ended in a draw by repetition.
- **AdjudicatedEvaluation (AE)**: The game was adjudicated based on evaluation agreement.
- **ForfeitLimits (FL)**: The game was forfeited due to time or node limits.
- **Cancel (XX)**: The game was canceled.
- **Illegal (IM)**: The game ended due to an illegal move.
- **NotStarted (NS)**: The game has not started.

Each `ResultReason` has a corresponding explanation that provides more details about the reason for the game's outcome.


## Analysis Mode

The analysis mode provides a user-friendly interface for analyzing chess positions and optionally comparing engine evaluations side by side. 

Analysis mode uses a `AnalyzeConfig.json` file - [Link to AnalyzeConfig.json](AnalyzeConfig.md) - to pick engines in order from top to bottom, so the first engine in the list will be picked for single analysis and the first two engines will be picked for dual analysis.

The dual analysis mode is designed to compare two engines at a time, displaying their evaluations, moves, and search statistics in a clear and concise manner.


## Puzzle Testing Mode

### Lichess Puzzle Testing Mode
The puzzle testing mode allows users to evaluate chess engines using a variety of Lichess puzzles, providing insights into their performance on specific positions. This mode uses the `PuzzleConfig.json` file - [Link to PuzzleConfig.json](PuzzleConfig.md) - to configure the engines, puzzle sources, and test parameters.

The `PuzzleConfig.json` file defines the engines to be used, the puzzle file path, and the testing parameters. In this mode, engines are tested on puzzles sampled from the specified file, with options to filter puzzles by type, rating, or specific characteristics. The configuration also supports running tests with node limits or concurrent engine instances for efficient benchmarking.
This mode is ideal for developers and researchers who want to test engine capabilities on specific puzzle types, such as mate-in-N problems, endgame studies, or tactical motifs. The results can be visualized to identify areas where engines excel or struggle, providing valuable feedback for engine improvement.
For more information about how to run Lichess puzzles, see [LichessPuzzle.md](LichessPuzzle.md).

### ERET Testing Mode

The ERET (Eigenmann Rapid Engine Test) testing mode is designed to evaluate chess engines using a set of carefully curated puzzles for rapid and precise performance assessment. This mode uses the `EretConfig.json` file - [Link to EretConfig.json](EretConfig.md) - to configure the engines, puzzle sources, and test parameters.

The `EretConfig.json` file specifies the engines to be tested, the puzzle file path, and the testing parameters such as time or node limits. It supports both time-based and node-limited testing, allowing users to choose the evaluation method that best suits their needs. The configuration also enables concurrent engine testing for efficient benchmarking.

This mode is ideal for developers and researchers who want to quickly assess engine performance on a diverse set of positions, providing valuable insights into engine strengths, weaknesses, and overall capabilities.
For more information about how to run ERET puzzles, see [EretPuzzles.md](EretPuzzles.md).
